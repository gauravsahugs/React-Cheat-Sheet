React Hooks

React hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 as a way to easily add reusable, stateful logic to React function components.

Hooks let us use all the features that were previously only available in class components.
Additionally, we can create our own custom hooks that give our app custom functionality.

Many React hooks were added to the core React library as well. We are going to cover the essential hooks you absolutely need to know:

useState
useEffect
useRef
useContext
useCallback
useMemo
useReducer

To answer when to use useCallBack, useMemo, and useEffect, we should know what exactly they do and how they are different.

useCallback:
The useCallback is a react hook that returns a memoized callback when passed a function and a list of dependencies as parameters. Itâ€™s very useful when a component is passing a callback to its child component to prevent the rendering of the child component. It only changes the callback when one of its dependencies gets changed.

useMemo:
The useMemo is similar to useCallback hook as it accepts a function and a list of dependencies but it returns the memoized value returned by the passed function. It recalculated the value only when one of its dependencies change. It is useful to avoid expensive calculations on every render when the returned value is not going to change.

useEffect:
A hook that helps us to perform mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects after all the components has been rendered. The useEffect accepts a function that is imperative in nature and a list of dependencies. When its dependencies change it executes the passed function.
